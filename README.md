INTRODUCTION

Hexcell is a new born package management solution for TonicOS.
Hexcell is completely open for everyone to use. It allows users to 
take source code for new software and package it into source and 
binary form such that binaries can be easily installed and tracked 
and source can be rebuilt easily. It also maintains a database of 
all packages and their files that can be used for verifying packages 
and querying for information about files and/or packages. Everyone 
can build their own package easily.

   it on other kind of system.
